Facebook announced three big new features today for its mobile app: live streaming, photo and video montages called "Collages, and a new dropdown menu for updating your status. The features are initially restricted to iPhone users in the U.S., but will eventually come to Android users as well. Facebook also appears to be testing a new concert ticket purchasing feature in San Francisco, but that isn't widely available yet. Here's a rundown:

Live Video Sharing Live streaming video apps have been a round for a few years, but the crazy really kicked off earlier this year with the app Meerkat, followed shortly by Twitter's Periscope, which allowed users to directly interact with their viewers. Never one to be one-upped, Facebook introduced the ability to livestream video in August with a feature called Live, but it was initially only for celebrities. Facebook finally began rolling out Live for all users today. But right now, you can only do it if you're a select iPhone user in the US.
